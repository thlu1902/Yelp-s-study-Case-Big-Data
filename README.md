# Yelp-s-study-Case-Big-Data
In this notebook, we will be looking at Yelp's dataset. We accessed and collected Yelp's data from Yelp dataset. Then, we profiled and transformated and conducted to the meaningful data and expressed them into graphs.  Project Question:  Users can vote the reviews of other users as "funny," "useful," or "cool." Do reviews of non-chain restaurants get more votes or more often get voted on than reviews of chain restaurants? Are there different patterns for "funny," "useful," or "cool" votes? Does this vary geographically? In other words, are there just more users voting in a big city?
